# Tetris Project
This is a personal project I'm currently working on. My goal is to recreate a playable version of the game Tetris from scratch on the Arduino platform. In the long term, I aim to have a custom LED display and button controls that this will work with. In the short term, however, the focus is simply on accurately implementing the game mechanics. 

The Random Bag Test sketch is a standalone psuedo-random sequence generator, attempting to create a random but non-repeating order of the numbers 1 through 7 in order to approximate the tetromino generation algorithm actually used by Tetris games.
