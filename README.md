# Tetris Project
This is a personal project I'm currently working on. My goal is to recreate a playable version of the game Tetris from scratch on the Arduino platform. In the long term, I aim to have a custom LED display and button controls that this will work with. In the short term, however, the focus is simply on accurately implementing the game mechanics.
